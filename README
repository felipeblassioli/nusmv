This is version 2 of NuSMV, the New Symbolic Model Verifier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NuSMV is a re-implementation and extension of SMV, the first model
checker based on BDDs. It has been designed to be an open architecture
for model checking, which can be reliably used for the verification of
industrial designs, as a core for custom verification tools, and as a
test-bed for formal verification techniques.

NuSMV version 2 extends NuSMV with new model checking algorithms and
techniques. It combines classical BDD-based symbolic techniques with
SAT-based techniques. It also presents other new features: for
instance, it allows for a more powerful manipulation of multiple
models; it can generate flat models for the whole language; it allows
for cone of influence reduction.

The BDD-based model checking component exploits the CUDD library
developed by Fabio Somenzi at Colorado University. The SAT-based model
checking component includes an RBC-based Bounded Model Checker,
connected to the SIM SAT library developed by the University of
Genova. Optionally, NuSMV can also be used with the ZCHAFF SAT 
library developed by the Princeton University and the MINISAT SAT
library developed by Niklas Een or Niklas Sorensson.

NuSMV version 2 is distributed with an OpenSource license, namely the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The aim is to provide a
publicly available state-of-the-art symbolic model checker. With the
OpenSource development model, a whole community participates in the
development of a software systems, with a distributed team and
independent peer review. This may result in a rapid system evolution,
and in increased software quality and reliability: for instance, the
OpenSource model has boosted the take-up of notable software systems,
such as Linux and Apache. With the NuSMV OpenSource project, we would
like to reach the same goals within the model checking community,
opening the development of NuSMV.

3. BUILDING NUSMV
=================

To compile NuSMV 2 follows the instructions below.

NOTE: NuSMV is also distributed already compiled for the most common
operating systems and architectures. See the "BINARY DISTRIBUTION"
section for instructions on how to install an already compiled
package.

NOTE: platform specific instructions for building NuSMV are contained
in the "PLATFORMS" section.

To build NuSMV and CUDD as them are distributed, you will need

  * An ANSI C compiler (gcc will do, as will several versions of cc)
  * GNU Flex version 2.5 or greater
  * GNU Bison version 1.22 or greater
  * GNU make utility version 3.74 or greater
  * GNU tar and gzip utilities
  * Approximately 32 MB of free disk space for building the system
  * Approximately 15 MB of free disk space for the installation

A few tools and libraries are required to have full features provided,
but they are not strictly required to build NuSMV. 
In particular:

   * A fully working 'latex' environment for generation of documentation
   * Program 'lynx' or 'links' for generation of online help
   * Library 'expat' for loading of counter-examples
   * Library 'readline' as a usability improvement. 


Furthermore, as a developer you might be interested in modifying the
NuSMV's source packaging structure, for example by adding a new source
file.  In this case a few other tools will be needed:

  * automake (GNU automake) 1.6.3  or greater
  * autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57  or greater
  * aclocal (GNU automake) 1.6.3  or greater
  * autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.57  or greater
  * ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.4.3


Basic building steps:

1. Download the most recent versions of NuSMV from the address
   above into a convenient directory, e.g., /tmp.

2. Move to the directory where you would like to build NuSMV and unpack the
   distributions:

	% cd /home/nusmv				# for example
	% gzip -dc /tmp/NuSMV-2.2.x.tar.gz | tar xf -

3. OPTIONAL: ZCHAFF and/or MINISAT SAT solvers can be downloaded and compiled.

   In Bounded Model Checking, the performance of ZCHAFF and MINISAT is
   usually much better than the performance of the SIM SAT solver. 

   For instructions on how to download, compile and link ZCHAFF and 
   MINISAT with NuSMV, read files 'README.zChaff' and 'README.MiniSat',
   respectively.

4. Move into the cudd-2.3.0.1 directory and run make, which will
   compile the CUDD libraries:

	% cd cudd-2.3.0.1
	% make 

   Note: at the moment, NuSMV 2 requires a modified version of the CUDD
   library. The CUDD library included in the NuSMV distribution must 
   be used with NuSMV even if another version of the CUDD library is
   already installed in the system.

5. Move into the nusmv directory and run configure, which will
   determine some system-specific parameters and create the Makefile:

	% cd ../nusmv
	% ./configure
   
   OPTIONAL: if you want to use ZCHAFF or MINISAT with NuSMV,
   you have to enable them. Read files 'README.zChaff' and
   'README.MiniSat' for more information. 
   ZCHAFF and MINISAT can both be enabled at the same time.

   Note: Not all checks will return "yes."  This is normal and should
   not affect compilation.  However, do be concerned with any warnings
   "configure" produces.

   Note: Occasionally, configure will make a bad guess or will choose
   a default you do not want.  In this case, simply edit the Makefile
   at this point.

   Note: You may want to specify parameters to configure -- see the
   "INSTALLING NUSMV" section below.

6. Build the NuSMV system by running GNU's make utility:

	% make

   This builds an executable "NuSMV" in the current directory.  

   WARNING: If you are not successful in building a NuSMV executable, 
   double check that:
   * you are using Flex version 2.5 or greater (check 
     using "flex -V")
   * you are using GNU Bison version 1.22 or greater (check with 
     "bison -V"). 
   * you are using GNU make utility version 3.74 or greater (check with
     "make -v").

   Having out-of-date versions of these programs can
   lead to obscure compilation and linking errors. You can download
   the new versions from the GNU FTP address above.

   NuSMV expects to find master.nusmvrc file, and a directory
   of help files in the directory given by the environment variable
   NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH. Set this to the "share" directory in the source
   tree:

	([t]csh) % setenv NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH $cwd/share
	([ba]sh) % NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH='pwd'/share; export NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH

7. OPTIONAL: Verify that NuSMV works by running it on some of the
   examples included in the distribution:

  	% make check

   This step requires less than 3 hours on an Intel Pentium II 300Mhz
   with 512Mb of RAM.


============
4. PLATFORMS
============

NuSMV has been tested in a range of architecture/operating system
combinations. It has been tested on PC Intel, Apple Mac and Sun
architectures, with different versions and distributions of Linux,
Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X.

File README_PLATFORMS provides detailed information about each
supported platform.


===================
5. INSTALLING NUSMV
===================

Administrators and people who want to discard the source after building
NuSMV will want to install NuSMV in a central area:

* To install the NuSMV executable, library, headers, and help files, type,
  while in the nusmv directory,

	% make install

  By default, this will put binaries, libraries, headers, and help files
  in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include, and /usr/local/share
  respectively.  To choose a different location, provide a default prefix
  when you invoke configure, e.g., to install in /opt/nusmv/bin, etc.,
  use

	% ./configure --prefix=/opt/nusmv

  when configuring NuSMV.

  "make clean" removes all the files generated during "make."  This is
  useful when you want to rebuild NuSMV with a different prefix, when you
  want to rebuild with different compiler options, etc.

  The path "/usr/local/share" (or whatever is set via the --prefix option)
  is hard-coded into NUSMV.  In this directory, NuSMV expects to find
  "master.nusmvrc", and the help/ directory.  This may
  be overridden by setting the environment variable "NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH" to
  the name of an alternate directory, e.g.,

	([t]csh)% setenv NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH /projects/nusmv/common
	([ba]sh)% NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/nusmv/common; \
	export NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH 


======================
6. BINARY DISTRIBUTION
======================

NuSMV is also distributed already compiled. To install the binary
distribution of NuSMV follows the instructions below:

1. Download the most recent versions of NuSMV from the addresses
   listed above into a convenient directory, (e.g., /tmp).

2. Move to the root directory where you want to install NuSMV. Let's
   say "/opt" and untar the distribution:

        % cd /opt
        % gzip -dc /tmp/NuSMV-X.Y.Z_Linux-i686.tar.gz | tar xf -

   This command will create a directory "/opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z" 
   containing the NuSMV files (X.Y.Z is the release number).

3. Add the directory /opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z/bin to your command search PATH
   environment variable: 

	([t]csh)% set path=($path /opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z/bin); rehash
	([ba]sh)% PATH=${PATH}:/opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z/bin; export PATH 

4. Set the NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

 	([t]csh)% setenv NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z/share/nusmv
	([ba]sh)% NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/nusmv-X.Y.Z/share/nusmv; \
	export NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH 

Now you are ready to run and enjoy NuSMV.
