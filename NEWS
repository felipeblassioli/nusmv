********************** NuSMV 2.3.0 (2005/07/15) **********************

This is a major release of NuSMV aiming to enable users to specify and
check properties expressed in PSL -- the Accellera (and upcoming IEEE)
standard Property Specification Language.

PSL is becoming one of the most popular property specification
languages across the EDA community, both in simulation and in formal
verification. It is intuitive, and easy to learn, read, and write. In
a nutshell, PSL extends linear temporal logics with the power of
regular expressions, and it is thus able to capture all omega-regular
properties. PSL is defined in four layers:

* the Boolean layer allows to write expressions over states.

* the Temporal layer uses Boolean expressions to specify behavior over
  time.

* the Verification layer consists of directives that specify how tools
  should use temporal layer specifications to verify functionality of
  a design.

* the Modeling layer defines the environment within which verification
  is to occur.

PSL is defined in various flavors, each corresponding to a particular
underlying hardware description language. The flavor determines the
syntax of the Boolean and modeling layers, and allows easy,
interoperable use of PSL across languages and design flows.

This version of NuSMV supports PSL with a new NuSMV flavor, and is
currently restricted to a subset of the Boolean and Temporal
layers. More comprehensive support will be implemented in the
forthcoming releases.

This release was developed as part of the activity within the PROSYD
project (http://www.prosyd.org -- Property-Based System Design), a
STREP project funded under the VI framework of the IST EU program.

* Minor changes

  - Fixed a bug in the interactive shell that inhibited the possibility
    to introduce and verify new properties to be interpreted and thus
    instantiated within a module declared in the input file.

  - Fixed a bug in the system interactive command 'check_fsm'.



********************** NuSMV 2.2.5 (2005/05/05) **********************

This is a minor release to fix a critial bug and a bunch of other
minor bugs. Also, the usability of command line option "-load" has
been improved.

* Commands and options:
  - The command line option '-load' now forces the interactive mode,
    even if option '-int' is not specified. 


* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a critical bug that prevented the model from being built
    correctly when the interactive mode was used. This bug did not
    affect the batch mode at any rate. 
  - Fixed an overflow error in the interactive simulator.
    Thanks to Alessandro Saiani for reporting the the bug.
  - Fixed the setting of system variables for reachable states
    computation in interactive mode, during system initialization.
  - Fixed several memory leaks and wrong string manipolations. 
  - Fixed parsing of end-of-line under Windows within ltl2smv.
    Thanks to H. Peter Gumm for the bug report.
  - Other minor bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details)



********************** NuSMV 2.2.4 (2005/03/17) **********************

This is a minor release. One critical bug has been fixed, as well as a
few other minor bugs.  Furthermore, some commands have been enriched
with new options, and a few new system variables have been added.

* Commands and system variables:
  - Enriched commands: 
    * write_order supports dumping of bits (option -b).
    * echo supports file redirection (options -o and -a).

  - Added new system variables:
    * write_order_dumps_bits: to globally control the way the 
      command write_order dumps encoded variables.

    * on_failure_script_quits: to control the behaviour of the command
      interpreter when a non-fatal error occurs.

* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a critical bug in the simulator that was affecting both
    the random and deterministic modalities, not the interactive
    mode.
  - In commands pick_state and simulate the option -a had a wrong
    semantics.
  - The command check_fsm wrongly printed out inputs instead of only
    state variables while printing deadlock states.
  - Other non-user side fixes and improvements.	See ChangeLog for 
    further details. 



********************** NuSMV 2.2.3 (2004/12/29) **********************

This is a minor release. A few bug fixes have been made, and some new 
features have been implemented.

* Improvements
  - ltl2smv is now invoked internally instead of as an external program.
    As result, it is not necessary to specify path to ltl2smv anymore. 
  - Improved performances of boolean and BE conversions by caching results. 
  - Improved performances of CNF conversion. 
  - Fixed syntactical errors within a few distributed SMV files. 

* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed bugs in memoizing of formulas during conversion of SEXP to BEXP.
  - Fixed several bugs concerned with memory leaks and incorrent
    memory access.
  - Fixed bugs in DIMACS dumping.
  - Scalar variables with range 0..1 are now considered as boolean
    variables.
  - Relaxed a few too strong assertions that prevented NuSMV to
    compile some correct SMV files. 
	


********************** NuSMV 2.2.2 (2004/08/06) **********************

This is a minor release.  
Incremental algorithms for Bounded Model Checking have been
integrated, and a new generic interface to Sat solvers (incremental
and non-incremental) has been implemented. 
Furthermore, a few bugs that afflicted previous versions have been
fixed.

* Features:
  - Added support for MiniSat solver. 
  - New generic interface for incremental and non-incremental sat
    solvers. Interfaces for Sim, ZChaff and Minisat have been
    implemented. 
  - New algorithms for checking of invariants and LTL properties via
    Bounded Model Checking:
    * for checking of LTL properties via incremental sat. 
    * "een-sorensson" for invariants via non-incremental sat.
    * "dual" and "zigzag" for invariants via incremental sat. See 
      the paper "Temporal induction by incremental SAT solving" by 
      Niklas Een and Niklas Sorensson for further information. 
    
    Many thanks to Tommi Junttila <junttila@irst.itc.it> for having
    provided the first working prototype. 

* Commands and system variables:
  - Implemented new commands: 
    * check_ltlspec_bmc_inc
    * check_invar_bmc_inc

  - Added option -a to the command check_invar_bmc (to specify
    algorithm to be used)

  - Added new system variables:
    * bmc_invar_alg: used to choose algorithm for non-incremental
      invariant checking. 
    * bmc_inc_invar_alg: used to choose algorithm for incremental
      invariant checking.

  - Removed file extension ".dimacs" from default values assigned to
    system variables:
    * bmc_dimacs_filename
    * bmc_invar_dimacs_filename

* Improvements
  - Improved booleanization of scalar expressions in bmc. Thanks to
    Angela Pappagallo <angela_pappagallo@yahoo.it>. 
  - Improved usability of commands in bmc interactive mode.

* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed several bugs of user commands for bmc. 
  - Fixed a bug that occurred when instantiating more than once
    a variable whose range was containing one value only. Thanks to
    Charles Pecheur <pecheur@email.arc.nasa.gov>.
  - Fixed a bug in the model checking code that caused assertion
    violation due to a missing intersection with fair states while
    starting computing counter-examples. Thanks to Charles Pecheur 
    <pecheur@email.arc.nasa.gov>.
  - Fixed wrong behavior of option -r in batch mode: only the number
    of reachable states is printed out now. 
  - Fixed wrong allocation when sat solvers but SIM were called
    internally.
  - Other minor bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details)

********************** NuSMV 2.2.1 (2004/06/23) **********************

This is a minor release. A few bug fixes have been made. 

* Bug fixes
  - Preprocessors invocation under Windows
  - Dynamic reordering works now properly.
  - Fixed a missing check of assignment of input variables, when
    arrays were used.
  - Variables are currently declared with the same order as 2.1.x
    series.
  - Fixed behavior of cmd line option '-o filename'.

* Contributions
  - Added examples/m4 directory containing a bunch of m4 examples, 
    kindly provided by Roger Villemaire <villemaire.roger@uqam.ca>.
  - Added contrib/nusmv-mode.el an (X)Emacs major-mode for editing and
    running NuSMV sources, kindly provided by Roger Villemaire
    <villemaire.roger@uqam.ca>.

* Known bugs/problems
  - NuSMV launched with -cpp option and no input file falls into
    segfault.
  - Under Windows, the usage of multiple preprocessors will make 
    NuSMV hang. 

********************** NuSMV 2.2.0 (2004/06/10) **********************

This is a major release of NuSMV. Several improvements have been made
with respect to NuSMV 2.1. The most relevant are:

* Major changes

  - Input variables are now interpreted as labels over transitions in
    the Kripke structure. This solves several problems, including
    incorrect behaviors with processes.

  - Improved multiple FSM management, with APIs to enable
    composition. Improved management of encodings from scalar
    variables to the boolean space, with API to enable merging of
    encodings and other functionalities.

  - Packages and sub-packages have been introduced to represent the
    most significant data structures. Each package comes with a
    library, that can be linked separately from the rest of the
    system. New packages include different representations of FSM
    (i.e. Sexp, BDD, RBC), and Encodings.

  - Traces can be exported in different formats: textual (original),
    TAB separated list (to simplify import in spreadsheets), XML (for
    web browsing). Traces in XML format can also be imported and
    validated.

   - Improved BDD variable ordering. The reordering process can now
     work at the level of the boolean variables used to encode scalar
     variables, and the ordering file can directly refer to boolean
     variables. This may result in more compact BDDs (e.g. for
     formulae like x = y). Thanks to Dan Sheridan
     <dan.sheridan@contact.org.uk> for the contribution.


* User Interaction

  - Input files can now be preprocessed with multiple preprocessors
    (e.g. cpp, m4); the invocation order can be defined by the
    user. Thanks to Roger Villemaire <villemaire.roger@uqam.ca> for
    the interface with m4.

  - Trans type "Conjunctive" has been replaced by "Threshold" and is
    no longer supported.

  - Improved interactive simulator. In the choice of next states,
    duplicated entries are no longer present, and a distinction
    between state variables and input variables is enforced. Thanks to
    Anthony Wilder <anthony.wilder@roke.co.uk> for the contribution.

  - Added some command line options: "-dcx", to disable
    counter-example generation for false properties; "-pre", to
    specify a list of pre-processors to be applied to the input file.


* Bounded Model Checking

  - Improved the RBC package by introducing some new simplifications.
    Improved the algorithm for the generation of the CNF. Thanks to
    T. Junttila <Tommi.Junttila@hut.fi> for the contribution.


* Porting and Other

  - Porting under Mac OS X (see section 3 - Mac OS X in the file
    README_PLATFORMS for details).

  - Native compilation under windows using MinGW
    (http://www.mingw.org/). This eliminates the requirement for
    cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) (see section 4 - Microsoft Windows
    in the file README_PLATFORMS for details).

  - Integration with the new version of zchaff 2003.12.04
    (http://www.ee.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.php);

  - Removed dependency on the tokens generated by yacc.


* Documentation

  - The user manual of version 2.1 has been split in two parts: a user
    manual and a tutorial.

  - The user manual has been updated to describe new commands and
    functionalities.


* New restrictions

  - Input variables can occur in LTL formulae and in fairness
    conditions. However, they are no longer allowed within CTL and
    invariant properties. 

  - The body of DEFINEd symbols can no longer refer to next value of
    any variable.


* Bug fixes

  - Fixed problems related to wrong results in presence of processes.

  - Fixed problems in the check for recursive definitions.

  - Removed BDD memory leaks in the code for dealing with LTL under
    full fairness.


* Performance

  - The regression test w.r.t. version 2.1.2 pointed out an
    improvement in the performances of the model checking algorithms
    (BDD and SAT) in the majority of the considered cases.


 * Known bugs/problems

  - Some temporal formulae containing a "liberal" interpretation of
    truth values (e.g. "(AX p) = (AX q)") are correctly parsed, but
    may cause an internal error. A restriction will be enforced in the
    next releases.

  - In some cases, a significant degradation in performance of the SIM
    sat solver was noticed as a consequence of the new RBC package and
    the CNFization algorithm. The precise cause of the degradation is
    being investigated (notice that zchaff benefits from the changes).

  - Pressing Ctrl-C under Microsoft Windows Operating Systems within
    the interactive shell will cause unpredictable behavior. 


********************** NuSMV 2.1.2 (2002/11/22) **********************

This is a bug fix release that solves a problem occurring on NuSMV
release 2.1.1 while checking for recursive definitions. Many thanks to
Yunja Choi for the bug report.

********************** NuSMV 2.1.1 (2002/11/08) **********************

This is a bug fix release that solves some problems showed by previous
releases.

* Generic
  - fixed a problem in the checking for recursive definitions that
    allowed to parse assignments with dependencies not broken by a
    time delay. (affected file nusmv/src/compile/compileCheck.c)

  - fixed a problem in the encoding that caused NuSMV to exit with an
    error when the BDD dynamic variable ordering was enabled. Many
    thanks to Yunja Choi for the bug report. (affected file
    nusmv/src/compile/compileEncode.c)

* BMC tableau generator
  - fixed a bug in the tableau generator that erroneously ignored
    NuSMV invariants in path of length 0. (affected file
    nusmv/src/bmc/bmcModel.c)

  - improved the performances of the Past LTL tableau generator.
    (affected file nusmv/src/bmc/bmcTableauPLTLformula.c)

* Documentation 
  - improved the user manual. Thanks to Thomas Wahl for signaling us
    the ambiguities. (affected file nusmv/doc/user-man/nusmv.texi)

  - fixed a problem in the on-line documentation of the
    write_boolean_model command. Many thanks to Andrea Fedeli for the
    bug report. (affected file nusmv/src/compile/compileCmd.c)

* Parsing
  - fixed a problem in the lexical analyzer in the parsing of very
    long comments. (affected file src/parser/input.l)

  - not recognized preprocessor macros now cause a parsing error.
    (affected file src/parser/input.l)
  
********************** NuSMV 2.1.0 (2002/07/03) **********************

This is a major release of NuSMV. Several improvements have been done
with respect to NuSMV 2.0. The most relevant are:

* New functionalities

  - Past LTL

    Now LTL properties can also include *past* temporal operators.
    Differently from standard temporal operators, that allow to
    express properties over the future evolution of the FSM, past
    temporal operators allow to characterize properties of the path
    that lead to the current situation. 

    Past LTL temporal operators are supported both in BDD-based Model
    Checking and in Bounded Model Checking of LTL specifications.  The
    extended LTL to SMV tableau translator for the past fragment of LTL
    has been contributed by Ariel Fuxman <afuxman@cs.toronto.edu>.

  - Full Fairness
    
    Now NuSMV supports two types of fairness constraints, namely the
    weak fairness, or "justice", constraints and the strong fairness,
    or "compassion", constraints. 

    A justice constraint consists of a formula f which is assumed to
    be true infinitely often in all the fair paths. A compassion
    constraint consists of a pair of formulas (p,q); if property p is
    true infinitely often in a fair path, then also formula q has to
    be true infinitely often in the fair path. 

    Old versions of NuSMV supports only weak fairness.  In the current
    version of NuSMV, compassion constraints are supported only for
    BDD-based LTL model checking.  The strong fairness model checking
    algorithm for LTL specifications has been contributed by
    Rik Eshuis <eshuis@cs.utwente.nl>.

    We plan to add support for compassion constraints also for CTL
    specifications and in Bounded Model Checking in the next releases
    of NuSMV.

  - ZCHAFF SAT solver

    The new version of NuSMV allows for the usage of the ZCHAFF
    library as the SAT solver in Bounded Model Checking.

    ZCHAFF is a very strong state-of-the-art SAT solver developed by
    the Princeton University. ZCHAFF won the SAT 2002 Competition as
    the Best Complete Solver in both industrial and handmade
    benchmarks categories. ZCHAFF has also shown a consistent speed-up
    in the solution of Bounded Model Checking problems. 

* Architecture

  Several aspects of the NuSMV architecture have been improved.

  - We have improved the management of the Conjunctive Partitioning
    management of transition relations. With respect to old versions
    of NuSMV, the new code is more modular and easier to extend.

  - The Bounded Model Checking code has undergone a general revision.
    In particular:
    - the file organization of the bmc package has been improved
      in order to enhance readability and extensibility;
    - a generic interface to Boolean Expression Managers has been
      added; it is now possible to replace the current manager of
      boolean expressions (RBC) with more advance managers (e.g., BED);
    - a generic interface to SAT solvers gas been defined; this 
      makes it easier to add support for new SAT solvers in NuSMV.
  
* Documentation

  - We have updated the user manual with the new features of NuSMV 2.
    Moreover, we have added to the manual a tutorial that covers
    the basic functionalities on NuSMV.

* Bug fixes

  Several bug fixes and minor enhancements have been done.


********************** NuSMV 2.0.3 (2002/03/27) **********************

- Fixed important bug in the management of the BDD-based 
  representation of the Finite State Machines. This bug
  lead to an assertion failure in the case properties were
  checked using the cone-of-influence reduction.

  Many thanks to Yunja Choi for the bug report.

  (Affected files: nusmv/src/compile/compile.h,compileCmd.c,
  compileStruct.c,compileUtil.c, nusmv/src/prop/propProc.c,
  nusmv/src/sm/smMisc.c)

- Fixed bug in the "reset: routine of the interactive shell.
  The reachable states were not freed during the reset, thus
  leaving garbage information that lead to failures in
  the following commands.
  (Affected files: nusmv/src/sm/smCmd.c)

- Fixed a memory leak in some routines added to the CUDDs to fulfill
  the needs of NuSMV. (Affected files: cudd-2.3.0.1/cudd/cuddAddOp.c,
  cuddBddOp.c)

- Extended printing routines to new operators XOR and XNOR.
  (Affected files: nusmv/src/node/nodePrint.c,nodeWffPrint.c)

- Enhanced CUDD routine that extracts the symbolic representation of BDDs.
  (Affected files: cudd-2.3.0.1/cudd/cuddBddOp.c)

********************** NuSMV 2.0.2 (2002/01/30) **********************

- Fixed important bug in the optimized tableau construction of
  SAT-based Bounded Model Checking engine. This bug lead to an
  "assertion fail" in the verification of formulas "p U q".  
  (Affected files: nusmv/bmc/bmcModel.c)

- Fixed minor bug in main routine of the batch verification: now the
  BDD master FSM is not built in the case of SAT-based Bounded Model
  Checking. This fix permits a substantial gain in performance in the
  case of Bounded Model Checking. (Affected files: nusmv/sm/smMisc.c)

- Disabled printing of memory/cpu statistics under cygwin. This
  fix allows for a clean compilation of NuSMV also on windows
  platforms. (Affected files: cudd-2.3.0.1/util/cpu_stats.c)

- Minor upgrades in the documentation and in the Makefile.

********************** NuSMV 2.0.1 (2001/11/14) **********************

This is a bug fix release that solves a problem occurring on SunOS systems.
Nothing relevant changes in the Linux version.

Many thanks to Rik Eshuis for the bug report.
